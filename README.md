# Tweet Sentiment Analyser [![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/57ce24b4f8b238dc/status.svg?token=IU6Gz621DpEFLrqsPOnrqw)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/57ce24b4f8b238dc)

An iOS App that lists the tweets of a given username using Twitter API and shows a sentiment score (sad, neutral, happy) for each tweet. It relies on **Google Natural Language API** to make this sentiment analysis possible.

## Architecture
This app was built based on a clean architecture model called **VIPER.** Basically, each of the letters in VIPER stansd for a component of the architecture: **View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router:**

- The **View** is the user interface, generally corresponding to UIKit components.
- The **Interactor** is a class that mediates between the presenter and the data. Gerenally, this is a UIKit-independent component that handles business logic. For example, in this app, it uses some Services to communicate with Twitter and Google API's to fetch the info we want to display.
- The **Presenter** is the coordintor of the architecture, directing data between the view and interactor, taking user actions and calling Router to move the user between screens.
- An **Entity** represents application data.
- The **Router** handles navigation between screens. In this app, it is also responsible to create the module itself and receives another name: **Wireframe.**
